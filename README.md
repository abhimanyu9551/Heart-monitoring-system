# Heart-monitoring-system
Designed and implemented an end-to-end solution for heart rate monitoring. The key areas of 
collaboration were amplification (INA126), filtering (LM 324N), and digitization (MCP3208). The
processed heart rate data is transmitted via Arduino and ThingSpeak IoT to the back-end devices. 
An Android app was also developed using MIT APP Inventor for monitoring.
